- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aaron-Glave
- 👀 I’m interested in...
  - C++, Python, and Kotlin
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Python. [My Python Check.io status](https://py.checkio.org/user/aaronglavenowbelivesingod/ "Starting over")
  - And C++. I'm working on a command-line chess program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
    - Understanding more about AI. I currently attend a class all about the *human brain*.
    - The more I know about the human brain, the better I could be at making artificial intelligence!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
  - Email: aaronglavenowbelivesingod@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: God literally saved my life and in doing so, he taught me that he was real and that he loved me even before I loved him.
      Now I know that God loves everyone! Including You!
